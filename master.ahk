We have a special type of film you can use for your design that we call our "3M reflective film". The film is mainly used to reflect vehicle headlights for safety reasons, but it can also be used to add a reflective look to your design in general!  

Since this film is only available through special pricing, you'd need to contact us to price and place your order for you. Does this sound like a decoration method that you'd be interested in using for your design?

If you're looking to reorder your design but need less than 6 items, we offer a special type of order called an Additional Piece order. With this type of order, we'll match the per item price from your previous order, and can apply that pricing up to 5 items total in your new order. There will also a $20 setup charge added to the cost since we're bypassing the 6 item minimum. This setup fee will ensure that these additional items print identically to the items from your original order.

Would you like me to help get that order placed for you now?

If you're looking to receive a copy of any print ready art file from your order, we'll need to submit an Art Release request with our art team.

For some added context - the reason for this is that some of the fonts and designs that are used in our Design Lab are licensed through partners we work with, and are not able to be released to our customers. If no licensed designs or fonts are found, we'll be able to release the print ready file as is. Otherwise, we'll only be able to release the non-licensed elements.

Disney has some very specific requirements that we have to follow in order to print designs that reference their Park and Cruise names, as well as some other details that need to be included. Here's a list of those below:

- Park or Cruise names must be their complete names (i.e. Walt Disney World vs Disneyworld)

- If a Park or Cruise name is used, it needs to be personalized with a group or family name, including a preposition (i.e. Smith family vacation at Disneyland)

- We're unable to print any official Disney Characters, or Character names, or any images that could be similar to those (i.e. 3 circles that represent Mickey Mouse ears)

- The Disney "font" cannot be used to print the Park or Cruise names

It's completely free to launch, and as long as you reach your individual print minimum to cover the order cost, your Fundraiser will successfully ship at the end of your Campaign. There's no limit to how much money you can raise!

We can change the Group Order Form Goal, however since payment has been collected based on your original Goal, there's most likely going to be a balance owed or additional credit remaining when the order is placed.

Here's the reason why. Lowering the Goal from its original number will cause each item's cost to increase. Since the lower cost was collected on each item in the order form already, there will be a balance owed for each of those items at checkout which you as the Organizer will need to cover. Alternatively, increasing the Goal from the original amount will cause a decrease in each item's cost, ultimately resulting in a credit or refund.

Based on this information, would you like me to adjust your Goal?

::#gofgoal::
copied := Clipboard
clipboard=
(
When you setup your Group Order Form it will ask you to enter a Goal. This Goal determines how many items you expect to collect, and also sets the per item price if you choose to collect payment.

When payment is collected, if you exceed your Goal any additional funds will go back to you (the Organizer) in a refund check; as long as it reaches $20 or more. If $20 isn't reached, those additional funds can be used towards goods and services at the time you're placing your order. Please keep in mind - we're not able to keep the additional funds as a "credit" in your account. 

If payment is collected and you do not reach your Goal there will be an open balance which you (the Organizer) will need to cover to complete full payment for the order. You're also welcome to cancel the order form at that time if you'd prefer.

While our Group Order Form's not currently set up to display various design colors within the same form, we do have some options that can help:

1. We can set up the order form with just one of the design colors on display. Then when you're ready to complete the order, contact us and we can leave detailed notes explaining which products receive which design color and get the order placed for you. 

2. We can set up a separate order form for each version of the design color, so your participants can see the designs in the colors they would print. If we go with this option you'll need to provide links to each order form for your group, so they can add or purchase their item in the correct one. You'll also need to contact us when you're ready to place the order forms so we can combine them back into a single order for you.

When the Group Order Form was originally set up, the Goal amount defaulted to the quantity minimum required to place an order on a high color design. Since the order form is set up to collect payment with individual shipping, there's no way to lower that Goal below the minimum or adjust the color count of the design in the form itself.

In this unique case, there are only 2 options that we can move forward with. You would need at least 48 items collected in the Group Order Form to place it, or we would have to cancel the Group Order Form and refund each participant. Once that is canceled, a new Group Order Form can be set up to accommodate the changes needed to fulfill the group order.

Which of these options do you think would work best for you?

The Group Order Form is limited to most print locations available in the Design Lab, and can only be set up on a Standard delivery turnaround. We do however have a way to create a cost "mark up" on each item, to reflect the extra cost required for more unique print and shipping needs. We can achieve this by setting the Goal lower than your original Goal amount.

With that lowered Goal, the additional cost "mark up" required will be added to each item in the order form itself. Please remember, to have no remaining balance left at the time we place your order, you must meet or exceed your original Goal and not the lowered Goal that was set to mark up the cost.

I noticed that your design has 5 or more ink colors in it. Anything that has this number of ink colors in the design is what we call a "High Color Print". Not all of the products we offer are able to print high color designs due to how they're set up in production.

If you'd like to stay on the current product, you'll need to either increase the amount of items you're ordering to at least 48, or you'll need to lower the amount of ink colors in the design to 4 or less.

Any sizes marked as "PAD" are just extra items that we send to our printing facility at no extra cost to you. We add these in just in case something comes up during the printing process, like imperfections in the product for example. This allows us to quickly replace those items and keep your order on track for delivery.
